# âœˆ Airline Load Factor Optimization â€“ India (2023â€“24)

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This project investigates the root causes of revenue leakage in the Indian domestic airline sector due to underutilized flight capacity.  
We performed a data-driven analysis of seat occupancy (load factor) across major airlines to simulate improvements and suggest route-level optimization strategies that can recover crores in lost revenue.

ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**
- Quantify revenue loss from empty airline seats using ASK, RPK, and Load Factor metrics.
- Simulate the impact of a 5â€“10% increase in load factor on airline profitability.
- Identify low-performing routes through loss-per-ASK analysis.
- Propose and simulate a 10% route capacity optimization strategy.
- Visualize loss distributions and optimization effects using clear charts.
- Recommend actionable strategies to improve occupancy and optimize operations.S

ðŸ›  **Tools & Technologies**
- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Sources**: DGCA Monthly Traffic Reports (2023â€“24), Industry avg. ticket prices

ðŸ”‘ **Key Insights**
- Total estimated revenue loss across 11 airlines: â‚¹11,000+ Cr in 2023â€“24.
- IndiGo alone accounted for â‚¹5,900 Cr in lost revenue due to 13.5k+ Mn unsold seat-kilometers.
- A simulated 10% improvement in load factor could recover â‚¹9,000+ Cr industry-wide.
- A 10% ASK reduction on low-performing routes can recover an additional â‚¹1,030+ Cr.
- Pie charts, trend lines, and bar graphs were used to visualize these insights.

ðŸ’¡ **Business Recommendations to Improve Occupancy**

1. **Dynamic Pricing & Flash Sales**: Adjust ticket prices based on booking window and occupancy; run last-minute deals.  
2. **Route Optimization**: Reduce frequency or merge low-demand flights to improve overall load factor.  
3. **Targeted Promotions**: Geo-targeted offers for underperforming routes.  
4. **Loyalty Incentives**: Reward frequent flyers more on low-occupancy sectors.  
5. **Bundled Packages**: Collaborate with travel agencies to offer deals with hotels/taxis/meals.  
6. **Fleet Re-routing**: Shift aircraft from low-load to high-demand routes.
